# Getting Started

## What is Trrack?

Trrack is a state-based provenance tracking library for web applications. **Provenance** means a full record of how something came to be — in Trrack's case, a complete record of every state change your application has gone through.

Instead of a flat undo stack, Trrack builds a **provenance graph**: a tree where each node represents a snapshot of your application's state at a particular moment. This lets users navigate history non-linearly — undoing down one branch and redoing down another — and makes it possible to jump to any past state by its ID.

## How it works

The core idea is:

1. You describe your application state as a plain JavaScript object.
2. You register named actions that describe how that state can change.
3. Every time an action is applied, Trrack records the resulting state as a new node in the graph, linked to its parent.

```
initial state (root)
      │
      ▼
  "Zoom in"        ← node 1
      │
      ▼
  "Filter by year" ← node 2
      │
      ├──────────────────────┐
      ▼                      ▼
  "Sort ascending"    "Sort descending"  ← two branches from the same point
```

Trrack stores state efficiently: it saves a full **checkpoint** when many keys change, or just a **diff (patch)** when only a few do. You never manage this yourself.

## What you can do with it

- **Undo / redo** — step backwards and forwards through the graph
- **Jump to any node** — save a node ID and return to that exact state at any time
- **Non-linear history** — branches are preserved; undoing and taking a new action creates a new branch rather than destroying the old one
- **Metadata and annotations** — attach arbitrary data to any node in the graph
- **Serialise and restore** — export the entire graph to JSON and reload it later

## Installation

Run one of the following commands to add Trrack to your project:

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
      yarn add @trrack/core
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
      npm install @trrack/core
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
